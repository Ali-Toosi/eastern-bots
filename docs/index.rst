Eastern Bots
==================

Using `aiogram <https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram>`_, creating a Telegram bot can be as simple as a few
Python functions. This means, you can add lots of little useful tools and extensions into Telegram with minimal effort.

However, it's not all about *implementing* your bot. You will also have to deploy it and maybe you wouldn't mind
making it open-source so others too can find it, use it, and improve it. This project is basically aiming to do that.

There is a CI pipeline in place so when you add a new bot it will be deployed for you. And it's an
open-source repo for people to check out and improve the bots they like.
